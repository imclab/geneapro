<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
Geneapro only has a limited number of features currently, but hopefully
things will improve.
</p>

<p>
This is open-source software, so feel free to contribute your ideas,
but reports or wishes.
</p>

<p>
Some general questions and answers that are common to all reports:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Is there a limit to the number of persons in the database ?</b>
      <p>No.</p>
      <p>
   Geneapro uses a real <a href="gentech.html">database</a>
   (postgreSQL, mySQL or sqlite) as its data storage, and they do
   not impose limits.
      </p>
      <p>
   Geneapro is carefully optimized to limit the number of queries. For
   instance, to display the pedigree, it needs one query per generation
   in your whole tree (even in the parts that are not displayed), plus
   a few others to get the birth and death dates. Using style highlighting
   for the persons does not add more than a few extra SQL queries, so these
   are all pretty cheap, especially when the database is also running
   locally on the same machine.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Does geneapro support same-sex marriages ?</b>
      <p>Yes.</p>
      <p>
   A marriage is just an <a href="gentech.html">event</a> in which several
   people took part,
   just as in any other event. These persons are given a role in the
   event (for instance "husband" and "wife"), but nothing prevents you
   from either creating new roles ("partner"), or using two husbands or
   two wifes.
      </p>
      <p>
   Some events and roles plays a special part since they are used to
   display the pedigree and fan charts (father and mother of a child for
   instance).
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Does Geneapro handle the implex ?</b>
      <p>
   The implex is one person appears several times in a pedigree (for
   instance, the same couple was the parents of two of your ancestors).
   Like all other genealogical software, Geneapro will of course not
   duplicate data about those persons in the database. In addition, you
   can configure the highlighting styles so that a person that appears
   multiple times in the tree or fanchart visible on the screen gets
   special colors (background or foreground) and/or fonts. This makes
   it easier to see them immediately.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Does Geneapro support sources ?</b>
      <p>
   Although support for sources is currently limited, Geneapro will
   nonetheless show a special tick mark next to birth, marriage or
   death events when they have a proper associated source. This is
   a convenient way to find out which sources should be updated.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>What format should I use for dates ?</b>
      <p>
   Geneapro supports multiple input formats for dates. In particular,
   the usual formats yyyy-mm-dd, dd-mm-yyyy, "yyyy mm, dd", as well as
   ambiguous formats like "about yyyy", "ca yyyy", "between yyyy-mm and yyyy".
   It also supports other calendars like Julian dates and the French
   revolutionary calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
   In fact, you are free to use any format you want, and geneapro will
   store it exactly as is in its database, and print it exactly as. But
   it will try internally to make sense out of it, for sorting purposes.
   This is done automatically.
      </p>
  </li>

  <li><b>Will Geneapro preserve accents and special characters ?</b>
      <p>
      Yes.
      </p>
      Geneapro's code is fully unicode-based. This means that all accented
      characters, asian characters and in fact any character you can currently
      type on your computer will be properly stored in the database, then
      manipulated by Geneapro, and finally properly displayed on the web
      pages.
      </p>
  </li>
      
</ol>
